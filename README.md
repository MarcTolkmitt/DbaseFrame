## <u>1. Overview: DbaseFrame</u>
Project to gain usage of Excel-,Access-  and Sql-data with C#.

My 'NPOIwrap' is closed for the reason that i believe 'NPOI' is <u>unsafe</u>. While debugging one of my programs these add-ons from 'NPOI' couldn't be deleted - they were hooked into the system and where denying their removal that way. You have to wake up to these hacks and move into action. For me it means starting  a new project with good old topics. The book 'C# 12 in a nutshell' claims to be a good source for this ambition ... so here i am today 15. October 2024.

Starting as example codes for my programs i plan to create classes that handle it all. I know understanding something is meaning you are not needing it - but you use OOPs for that convenience.
